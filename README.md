# Privacy Policies for the "Say It Again, Kid!" foreign language pronunciation learning games

Privacy policies for the language learning games developed in collaboration with 
University of Helsinki Cognitive Brain Research group  in research projects funded by 
Academy of Finland and Business. More on the project in UH's wiki: https://blogs.helsinki.fi/say-it-again-kid/about-project-in-english/.

The games are available in Google Play store: 

* https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Aalto.SIAK and 
* https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Aalto.SEAKArab 

Sadly these versions are stripped of the computationally heavy speech technology components.
